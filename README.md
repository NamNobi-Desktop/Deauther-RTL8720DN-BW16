Usage Instructions
You can download the complete Deauther package by visiting the following link:
https://github.com/NamNobi-Desktop/Deauther-RTL8720DN-BW16-Vietsub/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
Or you can go to the "Code" section above and select "Download ZIP" to download the toolset.

After downloading, open the file and find the folder named "Deauther_2-4_5GHZ" and click to open it.
Once opened, you will be redirected to Arduino.
In Arduino, go to the File menu in the top left corner and choose Preferences. In the Additional boards manager URLs section, paste this link:
https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_arduino/raw/master/Arduino_package/package_realtek_amebad_index.json
and click OK to finish.
In Arduino, click the ••• button in the top right corner and choose New Tab to add the remaining files in the folder.
You need to add the following three files: "debug.h", "wifi_cust_tx.cpp", "wifi_cust_tx.h".
Next, Upload the Code by clicking the arrow ➡️ on the left side of the screen.
Wait for the upload to finish, and once you see "Upload Image done," the program has been successfully uploaded to the RTL8720DN board.

On Mobile Devices (Phones):
Connect to the Wi-Fi network named "Deauther_2-4_5GHZ", Password: "123456789".
Once connected, open any browser (I recommend using Chrome) and go to the address "192.168.4.1".
Once connected, the system will show you a webpage to interact with, and everything will be in Vietnamese. Follow the instructions on the page!
> [!TIP]
<ins> If you're uploading the code for the first time, you need to delete the firmware from the manufacturer so that the new code can run properly on the board! <ins>
